# ED Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project showcases an **Emergency Department (ED) Analytics Dashboard** developed using **Power BI** to analyze ED visit trends across Ontario. The dashboard provides insights into ED utilization patterns by **region**, **age group**, and **gender**, highlighting trends and percentage changes between **2015/17** and **2018/20**. This work demonstrates my ability to clean and analyze data, ensuring its integrity and reliability. By emphasizing data extraction and predictive analytics, I aim to deliver meaningful insights that support healthcare decision-making.

3. **Filtering**:
   - Excluded outdated or irrelevant columns.
4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Calculated percentage changes and created total ED visit metrics.
5. **Tools**:
   - **Excel**: Initial cleaning and preprocessing.
   - **Power BI**: Data modeling, DAX measures, and visualizations.
